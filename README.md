### Description

This beta version of my networking component consists of two classes. The first "Email" sends email optionally with attachments encoded as base64 and compatible with the MIME 1.0 protocol. The other "Upload" allows for uploading of files through a web browser. Both were developed for use with Active Server Pages, but could be adapted for other uses as well.
 
### More Info
 
The inputs are all included in a MS Word 97 file included with the download.

The returns are all included in a MS Word 97 file included with the download.

No side effects known.
